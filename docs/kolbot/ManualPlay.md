## Manual.js

1. it's another script written by [@Laz](https://github.com/laztheripper) for manual play, with description in this saved [html file](files/ManualPlayScriptWithPacketSniffingToolsAndMore.html) or [pdf format](https://github.com/blizzhackers/bhfiles/blob/master/pdf%20saved%20pages/d2bs%20script%20development/Manual%20play%20script%20with%20packet%20sniffing%20tools%20and%20more.pdf). 
2. How to use (from bh topic):
	* copy the script [Manual.js](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/blizzhackers/documentation/master/kolbot/custom-scripts/Manual.js) and save it as ...\libs\bots\Manual.js
	* in your character's config add "Scripts.Manual = true;" (that can be near the line "Scripts.Follower = ...")
	* use D2BotBlank.dbj as starter script(entry point) for the profile.
	* in d2bs.ini (located in ...\kolbot\d2bs) you should set "UseGamePrint=true", otherwise you won't see anything useful in game.

3. if you wanna view maps + monsters while you are pressing < ALT > key you have to search to the line 727 of kolbot\tools\MapThread.js and to remove the 0x0D code. After that line is looking:
```javascript
        hideFlags = [0x09, 0x0C, 0x01, 0x02, 0x0F, 0x18, 0x19, 0x21];
```

## using followers

you can run your leader and to have up to other 7 followers in your game.
