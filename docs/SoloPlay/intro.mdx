# What is Kolbot-SoloPlay?

![extract into](img/logo.png)

*- "the one bot to rule them all."*

SoloPlay is a D2BS based auto-play system to level any single legacy diablo 2 character class from 1-99. That sounds like a bunch of verbage so let me break it down a bit. D2BS stands for ``Diablo 2 Botting System`` if you are familiar with Kolbot that is what you are using. SoloPlay only works for Diablo 2, so before you ask it is not for Diablo 2 Resurrected. Alright next, what is an auto-play system? In simple terms, SoloPlay works by set it and forget philosophy. It is profile driven so the only thing you need to worry about is filling out the profile with the correct format and then press start (how to set up the profile is defined below). After that it takes care of the rest, no setting up config files or settings files (like sonic or horde), ect. The goal is to be the fastest leveling system there is across all modes (classic/expansion, hardcore/softcore, ladder/non-ladder)

- This script is designed to be only run from [https://github.com/blizzhackers/kolbot](https://github.com/blizzhackers/kolbot). Most errors occur from using the wrong Kolbot repo installation. 
- **This script requires the English version of Diablo 2 to be installed.**

## Features

- Operates in Hell difficulty within 24 hours (the exception is the barbarian class that takes 48)
  - **NOTE:** Classic mode will take a little longer
- Final build options, or what the bot will build to (I.E Light sorceress, Hammerdin, ect) (see **[Frequently Asked Questions](faq)** for more info)
- Plays through and finishes the game
- Hire class/build specific mercenary
- Fully configured Auto Equip (Primary, Secondary, and Charms) for bot and mercenary
- Makes and equips CTA and spirit shield on swap
    - **NOTE:** Some classes don't use CTA and spirit:
      - Barbarian class uses duel Bo sticks.
      - Cold based sorceress builds use CTA and Lidless for the lower strength requirment.
      - Wereform druid builds use Mang-Songs Staff for the +5 all skills bonus. 
- Fully configured use of socketable items for both leveling gear and end-game gear (Adding Perfect diamonds to a shield like Moser's and later replacing it with Um runes if it's our wanted end-game gear) (see **Config.socketables** inside the base config file for more info)
- Kill diablo clone in expansion
  - Will try to share Annhilus charm if online and already has one
