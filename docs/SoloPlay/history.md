# Brief History

Kolbot-SoloPlay was built off the base structure of SoloLeveling by isid0re. Autoplay scripts/systems aren't a new concept, some to note are sonic, autoplay, and AutoSorc. None of the existing ones were able to do other character classes though so SoloLeveling was created by modding Questing.js. Almost from the beginning, Isid0re and I were bouncing ideas off each other. At that time, I was working on a separate project. We discussed ideas that helped both of our projects. I officially joined in around 4 months or so after the Github repo went public and was actively involved in the project until 6/30/2021. I contributed updates including but not limited to: item based respec, the overlay, logging equipped items, showing tier values on items, many bug fixes, sorting, D2BotSoloCleaner, performance tracking, ect. Due to some personal conflicts between isid0re and myself, I decided to create GuysSoloLeveling to have all of my ideas in one place. On 6/30/2021 I created this repo and on 7/13/2021 I made it public. On 9/1/2021, I changed the name to Kolbot-SoloPlay after some major changes in structure and continue to update to make SoloPlay the best leveling system for legacy diablo 2.
